# Semilocally simply connected spaces

A topological space is semilocally simply connected if every point has a neighborhood
such that loops in that neighborhood are nullhomotopic in the whole space.

## Main definitions

* `SemilocallySimplyConnectedAt x` - The property at a single point: `x` has a neighborhood with
  trivial fundamental group relative to the ambient space.
* `SemilocallySimplyConnectedOn s` - The property holds at every point of `s`.
* `SemilocallySimplyConnected X` - The property holds at every point of `X`.

## Main theorems

* `semilocallySimplyConnectedAt_iff` - Characterization in terms of loops being nullhomotopic.
* `semilocallySimplyConnectedAt_iff_paths` - Characterization: any two paths in U between the same
  endpoints are homotopic.
* `SemilocallySimplyConnectedAt.of_simplyConnected` - Simply connected spaces are semilocally
  simply connected at every point.

## Implementation notes

Our definition quantifies over all basepoints in the neighborhood U (i.e., the inclusion-induced
map `π₁(U, base) → π₁(X, base)` is trivial for all `base ∈ U`). This is sometimes called
"unbased semilocally simply connected" in the literature, and is stronger than the standard
definition which only requires triviality at the point `x` itself. However, the two definitions
are equivalent for locally path-connected spaces, which are the primary context for covering
space theory. See [arXiv:1102.0993](https://arxiv.org/abs/1102.0993), Definitions 2.1 and 2.2.
